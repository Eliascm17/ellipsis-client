# Ellipsis Client

Lightweight unifying client for RPC + BanksClient

There are no good unifying traits for Solana Rust clients. `EllipsisClient` creates a simple interface for sending transactions, reading data, and fetching transaction data. The ulitmate goal is to encourage as much reusable code as possible among both client apps and testing logic.

This software is still a work in progress.
